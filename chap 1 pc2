Your smile, your laugh, the way you say my name — I miss all of it. It’s crazy how someone can become such a huge part of your day, and when you're not around, everything just feels incomplete. I can’t wait to hold you again, to talk about nothing and everything, and just be close to you. You’re always on my mind, and in my heart — I love you more than words can say.")
